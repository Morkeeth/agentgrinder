"""The grind coach: `create_coach`, the dispatch-log hook, and the three modes.

THREE MODES, AND THE MODE IS ALWAYS PRINTED (the shape is MAGNET's `agent_run.py`, disclosed):
  local     (default) a real `strands.Agent` event loop over the five `@tool`s, driven by
            `ScriptedLocalModel`. No network, no AWS credentials, no spend. The loop, the tool
            registry, the dispatch and the hook are genuine Strands machinery; the token
            generation is a deterministic policy, not a language model.
  bedrock   the same loop with the Strands default provider (Amazon Bedrock): a language model
            actually choosing the tools. Needs AWS credentials, costs money, and sends the claim
            lines and result snippets off the machine. Opt-in, and the command says so first.
  none      the five plain functions called in a fixed order, no Agent. The fallback.

If an agent mode fails, this module does NOT degrade quietly: it prints the failure and the
exact reason, says which mode it fell back to, and marks the result DEGRADED.

THE DISPATCH LOG. A Strands hook on `AfterToolCallEvent` appends one record per tool call the
SDK executed (name, status, duration). The card shows "verdict produced by N tool calls" from
that log, and the number is the SDK's, not the plan's and not a claim.
