"""The coach policy: from the tool calls made so far to the next tool call.

Strands-free on purpose. `local_model.ScriptedLocalModel` replays this through the real Strands
event loop; `agent.run_deterministic_coach` calls the same policy against the plain functions
when no agent can run. One policy, two drivers, so the fallback cannot drift from the agent.

It is deterministic and it does not reason: read the run, check every claim, verify every
artifact, ask git about each, then write the verdict from the numbers the tools returned. The
paragraph and plan are templates filled with those numbers.
