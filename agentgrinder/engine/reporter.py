"""Verdict over a series of readings. Ported from MAGNET's reporter (itself from helicon).

Rules carried forward:
  - baseline when fewer than two MEASURED readings exist: a first reading is not a trend
  - helped / hurt only when two measured readings exist and the direction is known
  - unmeasured is NULL, never zero, and never counts
  - the comparison is this sitting against the sitting BEFORE it on the same project, by start
    time, so re-drawing an old sitting never compares it with a newer one
